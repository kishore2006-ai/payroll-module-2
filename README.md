# Payroll Management System – Module 2  
## Statutory & Compliance Configuration

### 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **Module 2** of a Payroll Management System inspired by Zoho Payroll.
The module focuses on configuring statutory rules required for payroll processing such as
Provident Fund (PF), Employee State Insurance (ESI), Professional Tax, and Tax Slabs.

The system allows administrators to dynamically configure compliance rules without
changing source code, making the application scalable and future-ready.
